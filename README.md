Process:
Gathered data using MaxPreps.
Polished and aggregated the data in order to summarize player performance and overall season stats in excel.
Used PowerBI to make visuals and an interface.

Season Records has data on season outcomes (e.g. Wins, point differntial, etc.)
Season Results has data on season statistics (e.g.team passing yards, team tackles, etc.)
Raiders players had data on statistics for individual players.
Sunnyvale Football Presentation shows PowerBI visualizations and notable findings from my analysis.
